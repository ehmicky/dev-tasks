Automated development tasks (linting, testing, building) for
JavaScript/TypeScript code (Node.js and/or browsers).

This is used in my own projects. This is not meant to be shared and semantic
versioning is not followed.

The task runner is [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), but you don't need to know Gulp
to use these tasks.

# Hire me

Please
[reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7117265228068716545/)
if you're looking for a Node.js API or CLI engineer (11 years of experience).
Most recently I have been [Netlify Build](https://github.com/netlify/build)'s
and [Netlify Plugins](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/plugins/)'
technical lead for 2.5 years. I am available for full-time remote positions.

# Workflow

Code is compiled from the `src` to the `build` directory using
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/), so you can use the latest JavaScript features.

Linting and formatting are performed with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/),
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
[Jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd). We recommend using plugins with
your IDE (code editor) for both Prettier and ESLint so that linting/formatting
is performed as you code.

We use [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to run tests. Each line of code must
be tested.

We use [tsd](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd) to test TypeScript types.
Each export must be fully typed using either TypeScript regular files (`*.ts`)
or ambient files (`*.d.ts`).

# Usage

Any task can be run using `gulp` for example:

```bash
gulp build
```

If you're on `cmd.exe` (Windows) use `npx gulp ...` instead.

# Overview

The main commands are:

- [`gulp build`](#gulp-build): build source files and test files. Must be run
  before running any code or unit tests.
- [`gulp check`](#gulp-check): lint/format the JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- [`gulp type`](#gulp-type): run TypeScript type tests.
- [`gulp unit`](#gulp-unit): run unit tests.
- [`gulp test`](#gulp-test): perform all of the above tasks.

Use `gulp buildWatch`, `gulp checkWatch`, `gulp typeWatch`, and `gulp unitWatch`
to run them in watch mode.

[GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) ensures that:

- tests pass on all supported environments.
- all source files are covered by tests and follow the same coding style.

# Available tasks

## `gulp build`

Build source files and test files:

- JavaScript and TypeScript files are transpiled with
  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Other files are copied as is.

Source files and test files are built from the `src` directory to the
`build/src` directory.

This must be done before linting or running any code or unit tests.

To add TypeScript types, use either:

- Regular TypeScript files (`*.ts`). An ambient file is automatically created by
  [`tsc --declaration`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#declaration).
- JavaScript files (`*.js`) and ambient files (`*.d.ts`). Ambient files are
  copied as is.

## `gulp check`

Lint and check source files:

- format JavaScript and TypeScript files with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- lint and
  [autofix](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems)
  JavaScript and TypeScript files using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (see the
  [coding style](https://github.com/ehmicky/eslint-config#coding-style)).
- find duplicated code with [Jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd).

## `gulp type`

Run TypeScript type tests with [tsd](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd). The
type tests must be named `*.test-d.ts`.

## `gulp unit`

Run unit tests with [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava). The test files must be
named `*.test.js`.

To specify
[Ava options](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/05-command-line.md),
please call `ava` directly instead. For example: `ava --update-snapshots`.

To target a single test file, use `ava build/test/file.test.js` not
`ava test/file.test.js`.

## `gulp test`

Runs [`gulp build`](#gulp-build) then [`gulp check`](#gulp-check) then
[`gulp type`](#gulp-type) and [`gulp unit`](#gulp-unit).

This is performed on CI ([GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions))
for each OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) and supported Node.js version.

## `gulp buildWatch`, `gulp checkWatch`, `gulp typeWatch`, `gulp unitWatch`, `gulp warnWatch`

Like `gulp build`, `gulp check`, `gulp type`, `gulp unit` and `gulp warn` but in
watch mode. The watch mode works even when installing/updating/uninstalling
dependencies or changing the Gulp tasks themselves.

They can be performed together, e.g. `gulp buildWatch` in one terminal tab and
`gulp unitWatch` in another.

# Other tasks

## `gulp warn`

Check for security vulnerabilities (using
[`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit)) and outdated dependencies
(using [`npm outdated`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)).

## `gulp releasePatch`, `gulp releaseMinor`, `gulp releaseMajor`

Release a new patch/minor/major version on npm and GitHub using
[`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it).

`npm publish` must be performed locally afterwards.

Only the repository owner can perform these tasks.

## `gulp uploadCoverage`

In CI ([GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions)), upload test
coverage (produced by `c8 ava`) to [codecov](https://codecov.io/).

## `gulp checkCoverage`

Ensures that files are fully covered by tests using
[c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8). This is meant to be performed on CI
([GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions)).
